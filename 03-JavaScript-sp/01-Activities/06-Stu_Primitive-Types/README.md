# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of typeof to Evaluate Primitive Types

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](06-Stu_Primitive-Types/Unsolved/script.js).

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)

[MDN Web Docs on JavaScript data types and data structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* There are two more primitive value types in JavaScript. Can you explain what `BigInt` and `Symbol` are?

BigInt is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 253-1. The largest number that JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number primitive is 253-1, which is represented by the MAX_SAFE_INTEGER constant. This has various uses where operations on large numbers are required.

Syntax:

BigInt( number ) 
or
Appending n to end of an integer literal
